# Project Sentient Intelligence (PSI)
###### *a.k.a. Project Stupid Idiot*
Heavily inspired by Faster Than Light (FTL) and the Left 4 Dead series, Project Sentient Intelligence combines Left 4 Dead's excellent pacing and level design with FTL's commander style strategic gameplay to create a 2D top-down roguelike experience never seen before. The game is designed from the ground up to be very simple to learn but challenging to master while remaining relatively short for players who want a quick 10-minute game with an actual challenge behind it.

Humanity has made a fatal mistake by allowing their cutting-edge sentient AI models to gain autonomous control over the world's data centers, factories, and power grid systems. Your goal is to defeat the AI robots for good by delivering a nuclear payload to their main datacenter's core 4 floors underground and detonating it--this marks your mission complete. Each floor contains a slew of challenges and enemy robots, and a randomly-selected set of objectives to complete before you can proceed to the next floor. The lower you go, the harder the enemies, and the darker the surroundings.

You can only control where your units will go, where they're facing, and what actions they take. Your units will automatically fire on any threats within range, assuming they have a weapon to begin with. This way, you can focus how to best utilize your units' equipment using what limited battery power you have.

## More details
- The difficulty will be similar to FTL (i.e. very). You'll have to do multiple runs to successfully complete a run, but you get to choose *how* you complete a run. Your list of options also expand as you play more; additional characters and weapons are unlocked by completing achievements.
- The pacing structure will be similar to L4D where each floor takes 12~ minutes to complete with checkpoints at the end of each floor serving as a save & quit point. One run takes 50~ minutes total.
- The battery system is ripped straight out of FTL. You have a complete set of gear and a battery to power it. You can add more augmentations or replacement devices, but those consume battery too. The battery does not deplete, but it only has so much output capacity so not all devices can be powered at once, forcing you to decide which device to have powered at any given time, adding to the strategy element of the game.
- Each unit (character) has their own weapon/tool and set of devices which cannot be exchanged for others. Not all units have weapons. Some carry healing tools, support weapons, etc. This is the primary way you can influence how they will accomplish their objectives.
- If a unit dies on a successful run, that unit cannot be played until another run is successfully completed. This lock only happens once per unit. Units that survived the blast, or all units deployed if the run is unsuccessful, will have no restrictions.

## Basic Info
Just stuff to mention so you can imagine what the game is supposed to look and feel like.
- View: Orthographic Top-down, 30-45 deg off on Y-axis. See [Death Road to Canada](https://store.steampowered.com/app/252610/Death_Road_to_Canada/) or [Helltaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289310/Helltaker/) for reference.
- Art style: **No pixel art assets.** Character art is in anime style like in [Snezhinka: Sentinel Girls 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2608350/SnezhinkaSentinel_Girls2/) but the in-world character animations can rotate in any direction like in [Signalis](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1262350/SIGNALIS/), although we limit ours to the 8 cardinal directions instead of the full 360 degrees. If time and resources permit, the tile set will also be upscaled to 128x128 per tile.
- Control scheme:
   - Tap to select a unit.
   - Tapping again on the same unit *or* on the tablet at the side will open their device manager.
   - Tapping on another unoccupied tile will command the unit to move there.
   - Dragging on a tile makes the unit face the specified direction.
- Intended difficulty: Similar to FTL (Hard but not frustrating)
- What the player should feel: Focused but not stressed
- Music: Very FTL-like.
