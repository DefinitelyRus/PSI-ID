# Project Sentient Intelligence (PSI)
###### *aka Project Stupid Idiot*
Heavily inspired by Faster Than Light (FTL) and the Left 4 Dead series, Project Sentient Intelligence combines Left 4 Dead's excellent pacing and level design with FTL's commander style strategic gameplay to create a 2D top-down roguelike experience never seen before. The game is designed from the ground up to be very simple to learn but challenging to master while remaining relatively short for players who want a quick 10-minute game with an actual challenge behind it.

Humanity has made a fatal mistake by allowing their cutting-edge sentient AI models to gain autonomous control over the world's data centers, factories, and power grid systems. Your goal is to defeat the AI robots for good by delivering a nuclear payload to their main datacenter's core 4 floors underground and detonating it--this marks your mission complete. Each floor contains a slew of challenges and enemy robots, and a randomly-selected set of objectives to complete before you can proceed to the next floor. The lower you go, the harder the enemies, and the darker the surroundings.

You can only control where your units will go, where they're facing, and what actions they take--no keyboard inputs required. Your units will automatically fire on any threats within range, assuming they have a weapon to begin with. This way, you can focus how to best utilize your units' equipment using what limited battery power you have.

## More details
- The difficulty will be similar to FTL (i.e. very). You'll have to do multiple runs to successfully complete a run, but you get to choose *how* you complete a run. Your list of options also expand as you play more; additional characters and weapons are unlocked by completing achievements.
- The pacing structure will be similar to L4D where each floor takes 12~ minutes to complete with checkpoints at the end of each floor serving as a rest stop to heal up and organize. One run takes 50~ minutes total.
- The battery system is ripped straight out of FTL. You have a weapon, some modules, and a battery to power them. You can add more modules at the cost of some power capacity. The battery does not deplete, but it only has so much output capacity so, if there are enough high-power modules installed, not all of them can be powered at once, forcing you to decide which device to have powered at any given time, adding to the strategy element of the game.
- Each unit (character) starts with their own weapon and set of modules. Some characters do not allow swapping of weapons and/or certain modules.
- Characters have a certain build in mind, with some focusing entirely on support \(i.e. no offensive weapons\). This is the primary way you can influence how they will accomplish their objectives effectively and efficiently.
- If a unit dies on a successful run, that unit cannot be played until another run is successfully completed. This lock only happens once per unit. Units that survived the blast, or all units deployed if the run is unsuccessful, will have no restrictions.
- By default, characters will prioritize targets in front of them then rotate towards enemies outside their field of view. This adds another layer of strategy while maintaining the game's simplicity.

## Basic Info
Just stuff to mention so you can imagine what the game is supposed to look and feel like.
- View: Orthographic Top-down, 45 deg off on Y-axis. See [Death Road to Canada](https://store.steampowered.com/app/252610/Death_Road_to_Canada/) or [Helltaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289310/Helltaker/) for reference.
- Art style: **No pixel art assets.** Character art is in anime style like in [Snezhinka: Sentinel Girls 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2608350/SnezhinkaSentinel_Girls2/) but the in-world character animations can rotate in any direction like in [Signalis](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1262350/SIGNALIS/). Though, we limit ours to the 8 cardinal directions instead of the full 360 degrees.
- Intended difficulty: Similar to FTL (Hard but not frustrating)
- What the player should feel: Focused, Somewhat stressed, Somewhat anxious
- Music: Very FTL-like
- Control scheme:
   - Tap to select a unit.
   - Double-tapping/right-clicking on a unit *or* tapping on the tablet at the side will open their device manager for the selected character.
   - If a unit is selected, tap anywhere to command it to move to the desired spot.
      - Tapping and dragging on the target destination will also make the unit face towards the specified direction upon arriving on the desired spot.
