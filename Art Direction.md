# Art Direction
This document describes the design direction for different game elements.

## General Instructions
- **Remember the theme (future dystopian).** Like in **Zenless Zone Zero**, characters come in groups of at least 3, and they all have a consistent style while remaining distinguished and unique. These characters often work well together both in looks and in gameplay.
- **Do *not* go overboard with details.** Don't tire yourself out. Only add details that will be noticeable when the character is 0.5 inch tall on your device.
- **Keep designs consistent.** The player should not be able to make an assumption that the characters were designed by multiple different artists. Small details like body proportions, line thickness, color palette, shading styles, and so on, should all be consistent across all character designs.

## Characters
This section states my vision for how the characters should be designed. Since it may affect how the characters will look, additional non-visual details about the characters have also been included.

### Backpack

**All playable characters wear a large "backpack" like in [Astroneer](https://astroneer.fandom.com/wiki/Backpack).** Unlike Astroneer, the items do not need to be displayed externally, but it should bear the same bulkiness and rigidity. It also has some glowing LEDs for added effect, like the blue oxygen tank at the top.


### Nuke

Note that they'll be carrying a nuke as well, attached to their backpack. It should look somewhat like the bomb the robots carry in TF2's Mann vs Machine. Don't worry about the weight. Let's just say they've developed some super light materials by this point.


### Weapons
**Everyone's weapons are energy-based.** None of them use traditional guns, rockets, missiles, or even magic. If it can't be generated with just electricity, it won't belong here. This means that most of their weapons will be themed around lasers, teslas, light, sound, etc. anything that doesn't need ammo.
