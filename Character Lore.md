# Tremor
Tremor is a full-time mechanic at his local bike shop. His wife and 3 daughters have passed away due to a vehicle-induced self-accident 4 years prior to the AI outbreak. It's why he picked up gardening as one of his hobbies to maintain his wife's garden, and regularly listens to Hatsune Miku songs his daughters used to play on the home stereo.

In combat, he is most effective when getting up close and personal with his targets. In doing so, his damage at long range suffers, but makes up in melee-range damage even with ranged weapons.
